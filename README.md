Python bindings for Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance
==========================================================

This repository contains the RVO2 framework, as described below, along with
[Cython](http://cython.org/)-based Python bindings.

Building & installing
----------------------

Run `python setup.py build` to build, and `python setup.py install` to install.

Only tested with Python 3.4 on Ubuntu Linux. If you have success (or failure)
stories, please share them!

Differences with the C++ version
--------------------------------

The `Vector2` and `Line` classes from the RVO2 library are _not_ wrapped. Instead,
vectors are passed as tuples `(x, y)` from/to Python. Lines are passed as tuples
`(point x, point y, direction x, direction y)`.

An example:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

import rvo2

sim = rvo2.PyRVOSimulator(1/60, 1.5, 5, 1.5, 2, 0.4, 2)
a0 = sim.addAgent((0, 0), 0.4)
a1 = sim.addAgent((1, 0), 0.4)
a2 = sim.addAgent((1, 1), 0.4)
a3 = sim.addAgent((0, 1), 0.4)

sim.setAgentPrefVelocity(a0, (1, 1))
sim.setAgentPrefVelocity(a1, (-1, 1))
sim.setAgentPrefVelocity(a2, (-1, -1))
sim.setAgentPrefVelocity(a3, (1, -1))

print('Simulation has %i agents and %i obstacle vertices in it.' %
      (sim.getNumAgents(), sim.getNumObstacleVertices()))

print('Running simulation')

for step in range(20):
    sim.doStep()

    positions = ['(%5.3f, %5.3f)' % sim.getAgentPosition(agent_no)
                 for agent_no in (a0, a1, a2, a3)]
    print('step=%2i  t=%.3f  %s' % (step, sim.getGlobalTime(), '  '.join(positions)))
```
